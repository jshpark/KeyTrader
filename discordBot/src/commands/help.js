      KeyTrader is a program for trading game keys between friends.
      The project is designed as part of the Chapman Software Engineering program.

      All configuration for the bot can be found at:
      https://keytrader.xyz/
      (Or wherever your version of KeyTrader is hosted)

      This bot has a few commands that are helpful for developers.
      To list commands, call:
      \`!kt_help commands\`
      (Note: KeyTrader refers to Discord servers as "guilds", to match the Discord API's official terminology)
